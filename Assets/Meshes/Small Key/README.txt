This ZIP contains two models: a high-poly display version and a low-poly version.

The low-poly version is about 1.8 times larger than the high-poly, but the high-poly seems closest to the intended size of the item (when compared to other objects).

The low-poly version should be scaled DOWN by about 0.555 if you intend to use it in a scene.
